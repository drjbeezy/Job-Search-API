# Job-Search-API
Create a Flask application that allows users to interact with a set of data from a web-based API.

### Problem Statement
Software engineer job seekers are looking for a trusted web-based API to search for software engineering roles in their current location. 

### Technical Requirements:
Index and show routes with appropriate templates, allowing users to view a collection or individual items from your chosen data set.

## Getting Started

These instructions will give you a copy of the project up and running on
your local machine for development and testing purposes. 

### Prerequisites

Requirements for the software and other tools to build, test and push 
- [Python](https://www.python.org/)
- An open-source code editor such as [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/)

### Installing

A step-by-step series of examples that tell you how to get a development
environment running

1. Download and open your open-source code editor. 

2. Download JohnBacoloresAPILab.py file.

3. Upload JohnBacoloresAPILab1.py file.

4. Register for an account with Adzuna API to access an app_id and app_key (REQUIRED)

### Running Localhost in Terminal

Open the Terminal and run the request:

    python JohnBacoloresAPILab.py

Open the Localhost Link:

    http://127.0.0.1:5000

Type in the path below and hit "Enter". Should look like this:

    http://127.0.0.1:5000/anitasoftwarejob

If you'd like to search by location, you can include the city to search as an additional path

    http://127.0.0.1:5000/anitasoftwarejob/Los Angeles
